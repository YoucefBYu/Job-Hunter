# Job Hunter

We can define this project as a job applying accelerator tool that helps student and job seeker in their journey of job hunting, the idea was inspired when we started our massive search for a Data science internship/traineeship this year.

The mean goal of this project is to help student and job seeker to optimize the time spent in their job applications, The project focus on the  idea of automatic generation of job application, getting as much information about the campanies, job, skills, Technologies, frameworks needed for target postion.

The app create , edit, costumize, and generate a cover letter and a resume adabted to the job description, the user can give the link of job offre (or linkedin search link) and his information as input and then the app gives as output the Resume and the cover letter correspond to this offer. 

The idea of applying Deep learning in this project is :
            
           ##- Achieving the goal of understanding the job description, 
            
           ##- Extract the key words to create the list of required skills, the job sector, type, Level of education...etc. 
            
           ##- mach the extracted information with the skills of the job seeker (user).
            
           ##- Generate text using OpenAI GP-2 for our fist prototype.

Other challenges we put in our TODO list: 
-  Extract information from the users uploaded 'Resume' 
-  Create graph data in Neo4j Graph database.
-  Use the data to make prediction of jobs for the user.
