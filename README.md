Web application that helps student and job seeker in their process of finding new job, the idea was inspired when I started my massive search for a Data science internship.

the mean goal of this project is to help student, job seeker  to optimize the time spent in their job applications, The project focus on the  idea of automatic generation of job application.

the app create , edit, and generate a cover letter and a resume adapted to the job description, the user can give the link of job offre (or linkedin search link) and his information as input (just the fist time) and then the app gives as output the Resume and the cover letter correspond to this offre. 

the idea of applying Deep learning in this project is achieving the goal of understanding the job description, and then extract the key words to create the list of skills needed, the job sector, type , requirement...etc. we try to mach this information with the skills  of the job seeker (user)
